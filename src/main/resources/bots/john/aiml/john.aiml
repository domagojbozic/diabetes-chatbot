            The liver can actually release too much glucose into the bloodstream when no food has been eaten.
            You should rather eat regular smaller meals with lower carb/healthy foods.

            Exercise is a stressor, so blood sugar will be higher immediately after your session.
            Also, blood sugars tend to be higher in the mornings because of hormonal activity during the night.
            Wait an hour after you exercise to get more realistic results.

            Since it's very important to have enough fuel in your system to cover your activity, the best way to determine

            If you are comfortable soon after your meal, that is a great time as you are well fueled.
            The best time to exercise is any time that you can fit it in as opposed to skipping it!

            For diabetes type 1, incorporate short sprints or high-intensity intervals into aerobic workouts to reduce the drop in your blood sugar level.
            For example, it may help to sprint for 5 seconds every 2 minutes during a 30-minute cycling session. Also, doing resistance activities before an aerobic workout
            may help keep your blood sugar steadier. For instance, consider lifting weights before you go for a jog or swim laps.

             You can most likely expect the steroids to cause a rise in your blood sugars and it's better not to take steroids

             microfiltered whey protein powder w/o preservatives, sucralose, or other additives in it and this should be done under
             nutritional supervision to ensure a good dietary balance.

            Diabetes is a serious disease that you cannot treat on your own.
            Your doctor will help you make a diabetes treatment plan that is right for you.
            If you have type 1 diabetes, you will need insulin in the form of injections or through use of a continuous pump.
            Drugs for type 2 diabetes work in different ways to bring blood sugar levels back to normal and they are mostly pills.

        <template>
            This kind of questions needs to be discussed with your doctor. While diabetes is incurable, a person can stay in remission for a long time.
            Currently, it is easier for a person to reverse type 2 diabetes than type 1 because people with type 2 diabetes can make relatively simple lifestyle and
            dietary adjustments to bring their blood sugar levels back into the normal range.

            No cure for diabetes currently exists, but the disease can go into remission. When diabetes goes into remission, it means that the body does not

            If a person doesn't need insulin, and is injected with it, there's a strong possibility of getting a very low blood sugar reaction,

            Chances of being misdiagnosed with diabetes are very low to none because a diagnosis of diabetes is clear via lab tests,
            and usually, blood sugars are high even with oral medications and lifestyle changes.

        <template>
            There are tests that can determine levels of natural insulin production. If you are truly type 1,
            you require insulin in order to live, usually via daily injections. With type 2, some people take
            insulin to help get glucose levels under control, but by adopting a more healthy lifestyle with
            diet/exercise, levels can begin to come under better control and insulin/medication may not required.
